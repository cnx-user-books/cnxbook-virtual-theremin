  <para id="delete_me">A theremin is an electronic musical instrument played by changing the position of the player's hands relative to two antennae. The instrument was created by LÃ©on Theremin in 1928. The traditional theremin senses tiny changes in capacitance that modulate the frequency of two internal oscillators in a principle known as heterodyning. A video of Theremin playing his own instrument can be found below.</para><media id="theremin-video" alt="Theremin Video" display="block">

<para id="eip-553">Our goal was to take the principles of the original theremin instrument and bring it into the 21st Century with the aid of some DSP. We wanted to create a computer instrument that needed no physical contact and that had two parameters of control: pitch and volume. Our project uses a computer webcam to detect the size, angle, and other parameters of an object and generates music using those values to control pitch and volume.</para></content>
